Sprint 1 – 2025-10-16
=====================

Context
- Scope: Fix crash when Slider receives None payload during startup/load; reported on Dynamic Thresholding → "Mimic Scale".
- Goals: Prevent sending/processing unusable params; keep strict failure for invalid inputs; no UI regression.
- Constraints/flags: Gradio 5.x, SSR disabled by default, JS allow/deny lists active.

Completed
- Changes: Adjusted server-side Gradio Slider guard to treat missing payloads (`None`, and `'none'/'null'` sentinels) as "not provided" and substitute the component default (`value`). Keeps errors for invalid/out-of-bounds values. Added NEWS entry.
- Files touched: modules/ui_gradio_extensions.py, NEWS.md
- Env/config changes: None

Validation
- Steps run: Static review; cross-checked that only `None` path substitutes default; other exceptions still surface with rich context.
- Results: Expected to resolve `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'float'` seen on startup for "Mimic Scale".
- Console/Network errors: None observed locally in code review. Runtime verification recommended.

Risks / Follow-ups
- Some events might still send unused inputs; longer-term we should tighten event wiring to not include extension controls in unrelated startup events.
- Consider mirroring this guard to `gr.Number` if similar None payloads are reported.

Next Sprint
- Audit event inputs for startup/load to exclude extension components where possible.
