## 2025-10-10 â€“ Codex Agent GPT-5
- Focus: resume backend txt2img refactor, expand deterministic coverage for CFG, hires reload, refiner hand-off, and LoRA flows.
- Context: operating in repository workspace-write sandbox without preinstalled pytest; heavyweight model assets unavailable.
- Plan: craft unit fixtures around `backend/diffusion_engine/txt2img.py`, harden runtime behaviour if gaps emerge, then update roadmap status to reflect progress.
- Risks: runtime parity relies on stubs; manual validation limited to unit tests once dependencies install.
- External testing workflow: when GPU-bound or integration tests are required, prepare runnable scripts/pytest targets, commit, push, and flag Lucas to execute on Windows 11 / RTX 3060 (12 GB) / Ryzen 9 5950X / 64 GB with PyTorch 2.7.1 + CUDA 12.8 + Flash Attention.
- Assets: `scripts/capture_txt2img_baselines.py` + sample config under `codex/examples/` capture deterministic PNG/metadata fixtures; see `codex/testing-and-tooling.md` for execution steps and required hardware.
- Follow-up validation: after local edits, run `python -m pytest tests/backend/test_txt2img.py` and execute the baseline capture command from `codex/testing-and-tooling.md` on the Windows host to refresh fixtures.
