# Refactor Roadmap

This roadmap aligns modernization work across the repository. Update it as milestones progress or priorities shift. Beyond the baseline webui upgrade, every stream must aggressively remove overengineering and wheel-reinventionâ€”**without** trampling the historical context or regressions called out in `codex/`. Favour the simplest fix that preserves behaviour and document any trade-offs.

## 1. Backend Modernization
- [ ] Port txt2img execution path to `backend/diffusion_engine/txt2img.py` with feature parity (CFG, hires fix, refiner handoff).
- [ ] Implement shared scheduler registry bridging `modules/sd_samplers.py` and `backend/sampling/`.
- [ ] Consolidate memory reporting between `modules/shared.py` and `backend/memory_management.py` to avoid duplicate UI toggles.

## 2. Flux & Advanced Model Support
- [ ] Document Flux configuration knobs in UI and backend docs; ensure tutorials map to runtime switches.
- [ ] Expand GGUF/BnB operator coverage via `backend/operations_gguf.py` and `backend/operations_bnb.py`.
- [ ] Validate LoRA+Flux workflows and capture findings in `codex/testing-and-tooling.md`.

## 3. UI & Accessibility
- [ ] Audit tabs defined in `modules/ui.py` for redundant components and migrate shared patterns to `modules_forge/ui/`.
- [ ] Ensure localization keys exist for all Forge-only UI controls. Track missing translations in `localizations/` issues.
- [ ] Improve tablet/canvas responsiveness by profiling event handlers in `javascript/canvas/`.

## 4. Extension Ecosystem
- [ ] Review bundled extensions for compatibility with the new backend interfaces.
- [ ] Provide migration guides for popular external extensions impacted by backend refactors.
- [ ] Introduce automated smoke tests for extension loading (target: top 5 community extensions).

## 5. Tooling & Developer Experience
- [ ] Establish linting presets for Python (ruff/black) and JavaScript (eslint) aligned with Forge style.
- [ ] Automate VRAM regression tracking using hooks in `backend/memory_management.py`.
- [ ] Document manual QA matrices for release candidates inside `codex/testing-and-tooling.md`.

## 6. Runtime & Dependency Modernization
- [ ] Finalize Python 3.12 + CUDA 12.4 adoption across launchers, stability matrix, and docs; verify smoke start on Windows/WSL/Linux with mediapipe-dependent preprocessors.
- [ ] Profile checkpoint/embedding reload latency and optimize directory scans (Issue #3048); integrate upstream weight-reload fix once Forge stubs support direct device transfers.
- [ ] Validate GGUF embedding loaders and soft inpainting pipeline under low-core CPUs; add regression smoke scripts leveraging new dependencies (joblib, protobuf 4.x).
- [ ] Audit legacy dependency pins inherited from preprocessors (mediapipe, OpenCV forks) and define migration/replacement plan for packages that block Python 3.12+ adoption.
- [ ] Track upstream divergence from ComfyUI and SwarmUI; document gaps and opportunities in `codex/comfyui-swarmui-postforge.md`, and open follow-up tasks for high-impact features.

Revisit this roadmap after each milestone, archiving completed tasks and adding new priorities that emerge from user feedback or upstream changes.
