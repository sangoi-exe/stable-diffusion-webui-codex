# Codex Documentation Hub

The `codex/` directory centralizes curated documentation for Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge. Each guide focuses on a specific aspect of the codebase to support upcoming refactors and optimizations.

## Directory Map
- `architecture-overview.md` — High-level system map and execution flow.
- `backend.md` — Details on inference backends, schedulers, and supporting utilities.
- `frontend.md` — Gradio interface structure, static assets, and client integrations.
- `extensions-and-integrations.md` — Core extension points and bundled integrations.
- `testing-and-tooling.md` — Available scripts, diagnostics, and recommended validation routines.
- `refactor-roadmap.md` — Current modernization goals and prioritized tasks.

Use these documents together when planning changes: begin with the architecture overview, consult the component-specific guides, and keep the roadmap visible to maintain alignment with modernization goals.
